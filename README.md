# ***Diwali Sales analysis Using Python***   
## ***Data Analysis Project using Python & Matplotlib/Seaborn***  
## ***Objective***  
The primary objective of this project was to analyze Diwali sales data and uncover consumer behavior, product preferences, and region-wise performance. The entire analysis was constructed in Python using Jupyter Notebook, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling and visualization. The project aims to help businesses make informed decisions during festive campaigns by understanding sales drivers.  

## ***Tasks Completed***  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**    
   • Removed blank/unnecessary columns (`Status`, `unnamed1`)    
   • Handled missing values and standardized data formats    
   • Converted relevant columns (like `Amount`) to correct data types    
   • Renamed columns for clarity
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   • Used `describe()` and `groupby()` to summarize data by demographic and geographic segments  
   • Analyzed customer behavior by Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, and Occupation    
   • Explored sales trends by State, Product Category, and Product ID    
   • Performed visual comparisons using bar charts and count plots    

4. **Data Visualization:**  
   • Created visual insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`    
   • Plotted bar graphs for Gender vs. Amount, Age Group vs. Orders, State-wise Orders & Revenue    
   • Used count plots to display distributions by Occupation, Product Category, and Marital Status    
   • Customized plots with labels, colors, and sizes for better clarity   

5. **Top Product & Category Analysis:**  
   • Identified top 10 best-selling products by total orders    
   • Analyzed top contributing product categories (Food, Clothing, Electronics)    
   • Investigated revenue concentration in key product areas    
 
## ***Key Insights***    
• **Gender:** Female customers made more purchases and contributed more to total revenue than males.   
• **Age Group:** Most active buyers are between 26–35 years, primarily women.    
• **State:** Top performing states are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.    
• **Marital Status:** Married women showed the highest purchasing power.    
• **Occupation:** Buyers from IT, Healthcare, and Aviation dominated the sales.    
• **Product Category:** Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most purchased product types.    
• **Top Products:** A few specific product IDs stood out with the highest number of orders.  

# ***Conclusion***
This project, built entirely in Python using Jupyter Notebook, demonstrates the power of EDA in deriving real business insights. It highlights that married women aged 26–35 from top states like UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, or Aviation, are the key customers during Diwali. Their purchases were concentrated in Food, Clothing, and Electronics—which can help businesses plan inventory and marketing strategies during festive seasons.
