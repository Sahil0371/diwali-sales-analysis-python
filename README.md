# ***Diwali Sales analysis Using Python***   
## ***Data Analysis Project using Python & Matplotlib/Seaborn***  
## ***Objective***  
The primary objective of this project was to analyze Diwali sales data and uncover consumer behavior, product preferences, and region-wise performance. The entire analysis was constructed in Python using Jupyter Notebook, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling and visualization. The project aims to help businesses make informed decisions during festive campaigns by understanding sales drivers.  
## ***Tasks Completed***  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
   • Removed blank/unnecessary columns (`Status`, `unnamed1`)    
   • Handled missing values and standardized data formats    
   • Converted relevant columns (like `Amount`) to correct data types    
   • Renamed columns for clarity
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   • Used `describe()` and `groupby()` to summarize data by demographic and geographic segments  
   • Analyzed customer behavior by Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, and Occupation  
   • Explored sales trends by State, Product Category, and Product ID  
   • Performed visual comparisons using bar charts and count plots  

4. **Data Visualization:**
   • Created visual insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  
   • Plotted bar graphs for Gender vs. Amount, Age Group vs. Orders, State-wise Orders & Revenue  
   • Used count plots to display distributions by Occupation, Product Category, and Marital Status  
   • Customized plots with labels, colors, and sizes for better clarity  

5. **Top Product & Category Analysis:**
   • Identified top 10 best-selling products by total orders  
   • Analyzed top contributing product categories (Food, Clothing, Electronics)  
   • Investigated revenue concentration in key product areas  

6. **Conclusion Building:**
   • Summarized key insights into buyer demographics and product trends  
   • Highlighted high-potential customer segments and states for marketing focus  
   • Presented all findings in a structured format to support business decisions
